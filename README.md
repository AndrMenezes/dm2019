## Binary Classifications: A study to classify patients with heart disease
In this work I discuss logistic regression, LDA and QDA in order to classify
if the patient has heart disease.

## Decision Trees: Bagging, Random Forest and Boosting
This work is a complement of the first. Here I describe the techniques of
decision tree and the approach bagging, random forest and boosting to improve
the classification by decision tree.

## An Empirical Comparison between Support Vector Machines and Logistic Regression
In this work I compare empirically the performance of SVM by using different Kernels with
the classical logistic regression. The data set used is related to the rat genotype.
